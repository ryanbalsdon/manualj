## Heat Loss

Maximum heat loss is in the early morning, when outside temperatures are lowest.

### Outside design condition

We use 97.5% cold temperatures, not peak cold temperatures, to avoid oversizing equipment. Oversized equipment is inefficient.

### Building Losses

Heat is lost through:
 - Glass windows and doors (especially solid doors) are much less insulated then the walls.
 - Walls above and below the ground act very differently
 - Partitions that separate spaces, like the walls of a connected grarage.
 - Through ceilings or roofs.
 - Floors or ceilings separating a crawl space or garage.
 - Solid foundation floors like a slab or a basement floor.
 - Air infiltration through cracks, holes, and people opening and closing doors.
